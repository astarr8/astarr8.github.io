			Inside the Light Cone is a blog about my past, present, and future- as a female in highschool- the first female president of my highschool robotics team!
			From physics to hot cocoa, my name is Abby, and this is everything that lies under my personal light cone.

			On Saturday, December 3rd, we had one of the best robotics competition I have ever attended. Now, I have been to the worlds event in
			St. Louis for FIRST, the coulmination of all of their programs into one massive robotics extraviganza. But this tournament was different,
			It started off like any other day, waking up and leaving the house when it was still dark, arriving at school when it was still dark,
			and once again leaving school when it was still dark. We arrived to the host school as soon as it opened. But this was when the differences
			started to arrise. For the first time ever we passed inspection on the first try. There are myriad ways to fail inspection, and
			I have done all of them:
			<ul id="inspectionList">
				<li> Doesn't fit in the sizing cube </li>
				<li> Too sharp </li>
				<li> Forgot the back up battery </li>
				<li> Too many zipties </li>
				<li> Not enough zipties </li>
			</ul>

			But today, the worst thing about inspection was the 15 minute line I had to wait in. Immmediately following inspection, I recieved an extatic text,
			celebrating the fact that Dan Green was in attendance of the tournament. Dan Green, the director of FIRST in Illinois, the image of FIRST, is a 
			celebrity in the robotics world, at least for me and my friends. Even though this was a Vex tournament, it was Dan Green's home turf, 
			and the center of many people in the robotics community- Rolling Meatows. When the schedule came, we were a bit concerned, as we were paired with 
			the worst team from my school, a team that could barely hold their own weight, and one that I continually doubt the state of their robot every day.
			They tipped in the first thirty seconds of the match. But, we won the autonomous, our strongest skill, so we headed into the rest of the match with 
			confidence. After the remaining minute and fourty five seconds, we weren't sure if we had one, but sure enough when we checked the standings
			we were in first. Continuing this pattern, we continually won until we kept this coveted position of first at the end of qualifications. 
			Margaret Thatcher actually puled it off, she was the best robot in the whole tournament, and she had the best, most repeatable autonomous that I have
			seen. But this is where my job came around, the team scout. Since we were in first place, we could have any team we wanted, but who did we want? 
			Would they even say yes? After watching the qualifications, it became clear who we wanted quickly- 333x. Mokito, 333x, is a brand name team that is famous
			online, and in person, they have gone to worlds for the past three years, and the thought that we were in a position to pick them, and that we were truly 
			better than them was the best I have felt in a while. With our autonomous and their hanging robot, we were able to remain almost undefeated in the 
			eliminations. The only match we lost was when we sat out and 333x ran thier auto, in which their robot tipped and could not right themselves. Some people
			like to say that we were undefeated that say, but you have to take defeats as an alliance, not just as a core team: gracious professionalism.

			After tking the ACT today, I came away with mostly positive thoughts. Yes, I probably didn't do very well on the english portion, 
			and the math was much harder than noraml, but after discussing that with some friends, I have increasing confidence. But one question
			in particular on this math portion stood out to me. The question, which I don't remember the exact wording or math behind it, described a woman,
			let's name her Suzanne, who was drafting a fantasy football team. There was a list of several categories of players, such as kicker, quarterback,
			ect. and listed the number of players in that category. The test then expected you to be able to find the probability of Suzanne 
			picking a quarterback if she picked completly randomly. While this question seems progressive because it displays a woman actually participating in
			a stereotypically male activity, this question sets us back farther. The way the question was written, implied that Suzanne would have to pick randomly, 
			because she didn't know anything about football. Picking someone for fantasy football isn't hard to make an educated guess on, one can spend less than 
			five minutes reviewing basic statistics on football and end up choosing someone that is not terrible. Not even looking the stats, Suzanne should 
			at least know she needs a variety of players to have a chance at success. Taking all of these factors into account, there is no reason Suzanne 
			should be picking randomly, and making the assumption that is a simple messagionsitic stance that has no place on a national test. 
			I paid a lot of money to take this test, and when I take five hours out of my day to take this, the weekend before finals, I would
			like to know that the ACT company does not descriminating against me. Now I know that I enjoy tons of privelages as a white American,
			and that there are worse offences against the other minorities of the world, but this question was very easily avoidable. There are 
			many other probability questions that the test creators can make, there is absolutely no need to exxagerate any stereotypes against any person.
			All of this being said, I need to say how lucky I am to be taking this test, the fact that I am taking it means that I need it to apply 
			to college, and that I have an opportunity to go to college. I do not want to be conciliatory to the sexist test writers, but to take 
			action against the gilded society we have as a direct result of the cracking foundation that was formed for us hundreds of years ago.

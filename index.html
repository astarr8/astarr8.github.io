			Inside the Light Cone is a blog about my past, present, and future- as a female in highschool- the first female president of my highschool robotics team!
			From physics to hot cocoa, my name is Abby, and this is everything that lies under my personal light cone.

			On Saturday, December 3rd, we had one of the best robotics competition I have ever attended. Now, I have been to the worlds event in
			St. Louis for FIRST, the coulmination of all of their programs into one massive robotics extraviganza. But this tournament was different,
			It started off like any other day, waking up and leaving the house when it was still dark, arriving at school when it was still dark,
			and once again leaving school when it was still dark. We arrived to the host school as soon as it opened. But this was when the differences
			started to arrise. For the first time ever we passed inspection on the first try. There are myriad different ways to fail inspection, and
			I have done all of them:
			<ul id="entries">
				<li> Doesn't fit in the sizing cube </li>
				<li> Too sharp </li>
				<li> Forgot the back up battery </li>
				<li> Too many zipties </li>
				<li> Not enough zipties </li>
			</ul>
